**URL to the claim’s source:** https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/10/21/oh-the-horror-climate-change-to-make-more-rain-in-the-sahara-desert/

**1-2 sentence summary of the claim:** A climatically dry region (the Sahara Desert) is expected to increase in rainfall by 75% as a consequence of global warming.

**1-2 sentence explanation of why it prompted you to rethink or question your current views:** I anticipated that dry regions would increase due to climate change, increasing the overall frequency and severity of droughts globally. Rising temperatures increase evaporation, so the increase in precipitation was contradictory to my prediction.

**URL to the claim’s source:** https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/10/21/oh-the-horror-climate-change-to-make-more-rain-in-the-sahara-desert/

**1-2 sentence summary of the claim:** The theoretical threats associated with climate change are a cash grab (“Catastrophic Anthropogenic (Human-caused) Global Warming: CAGW”) exploited by environmental groups. There is evidence that climate change is largely driven by the Sun, and not carbon dioxide. 

**1-2 sentence explanation of why it prompted you to rethink or question your current views:** The media led me to believe that human factors largely drove climate change, but natural factors are more influential, according to this article. I was shocked that only 1-3% of surveyed scientists’ academic papers agree that catastrophic climate change is fueled by human activity.

**URL to the claim’s source:** https://climatechange101.ca/social-costs-of-carbon-are-skewed/

**1-2 sentence summary of the claim:** The Social Cost of Carbon (the estimated economic harm resulting from carbon emissions) is exaggerated and unreliable, because speculative computer models often overpredict global warming instead of using real-world temperature data (currently equating to ¼ of predicted warming).

**1-2 sentence explanation of why it prompted you to rethink or question your current views:** I had always assumed the social cost of carbon was based on reliable scientific data and accurately depicted the economic and environmental damage of emissions (since it is used to calculate carbon taxes). Carbon taxes, based on these estimates, might be set too high if the Social Cost of Carbon is unreliable. 

**URL to the claim’s source:** https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/10/26/10348904/

**1-2 sentence summary of the claim:** 0.6 meters of future sea-level rise could be avoided if emissions between 2020 and 2090 are reduced in accordance with the guidelines of the 2016 Paris Agreement.

**1-2 sentence explanation of why it prompted you to rethink or question your current views:** The significant, direct limitation on sea-level rise made me rethink the value I had underestimated of initiatives like switching from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric vehicles. The cited barriers to such initiatives are easily remediable, such as the lack of charging station availability.

**URL to the claim’s source:** https://www.drroyspencer.com/2025/09/the-hottest-summer-days-in-the-u-s-have-barely-warmed-in-the-last-40-years/

**1-2 sentence summary of the claim:** The hottest summer days across the U.S. have shown minimal and insignificant warming (around 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit). The coolest days and nighttime temperatures have warmed significantly, more so due to urbanization rather than global climate forcing.

**1-2 sentence explanation of why it prompted you to rethink or question your current views:** I had expected global warming to cause equally noticeable temperature increases, and was not anticipating a distinction to occur between the hottest and coolest days. This claim also suggests that the reduction of urbanization reduces warming in a local context, explaining differences in warming distribution.

# Increased Rainfall in Climatically Dry Region: Claim
The Sahara Desert, which is a climatically dry region, is expected to increase in rainfall by 75% as a consequence of global warming. This claim is of particular interest because it contradicts the general expectation that dry areas become drier with rising temperatures. Due to the association of heat with evaporation, increased overall drought frequency and severity are commonly recognized consequences of climate change. The article conversely claims that rainfall is expected to increase in southeastern and south-central Africa. 

The credibility of the source, at first glance, is questionable in contrast to that of a standard peer-reviewed scientific article. The host site itself, a personal blog named Watts Up With That?, boasts that it is “the world’s most viewed site on global warming and climate change” with no evidence to back up this claim. The author of all articles on the site is Anthony Watts, who provides linked credentials on his introductory page. He is a retired 25-year AMS television meteorologist who also operates a weather technology and content business, claiming weather data processing, measurement, and presentation to be among his strengths. He also admits that he is not a degreed climate scientist, but points out that he shares the same similarities as Al Gore (who specialized in climate presentation and infamously led the US Senate Delegation to the UN Conference on Environment and Development). The purpose of his blog is to present weather and climate data in a form that the public can understand and discuss. In regard to the source specifically, the purpose was to educate the audience on changing rainfall patterns and the preparation required to address consequences adequately. These consequences included flood management and drought-resistant crops. In terms of accuracy, the source bases its claims on predictive modeling from the University of Illinois Chicago Climate Research Lab and links a related article in-text (Kurtzwell 2025). However, no figures or detailed statistical data are included. The news article links the scientific basis for Watts’ blog: a published, peer-reviewed scientific paper in the reputable Nature journal (Taguela et al. 2025). The paper was published in June 2025, followed by the news article twelve days ago and Watts’ blog six days ago. All information presented is recent, which is crucial for ensuring accuracy in predictive modeling. 

Ultimately, the short length of Watts’ blog post (439 words) enabled it to serve as a flashy introduction to the topic. It piqued readers’ attention in a digestible manner and linked credentialed sources for verification and greater depth. The scientific paper in the Nature journal titled “Understanding drivers and uncertainty in projected African precipitation” includes eight graphical figures. These figures depict results from predictive scenarios run using CMIP6 models. CMIP6 refers to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, which is an international climate research initiative that coordinates global climate model experiments to evaluate simulated past, present, and future climate conditions. The vertical thermodynamic processes expected to drive precipitation increases (temperature-induced moisture retention and enhanced moisture convergence) are well-explained and backed by multiple cited, peer-reviewed studies in the paper (Monerie et al. 2017, Sylla et al. 2016, Biasutti 2013). The paper also highlights community relevance by exploring the associated implications for water resources, agriculture, and ecosystems. This enhances the applicability of the arguments presented, thereby strengthening their logical validity. Finally addressing objectivity, the post begins with an italicized sarcastic and skeptical remark from the author that sets a dismissive, biased tone towards climate change enthusiasts. Despite this beginning, the blog post largely consists of facts, quotes, and evidence-based findings.

# Common Themes
Among the most compelling articles I read, many began with a striking fact or personal anecdote to capture attention before introducing evidence. This set the tone in a manner different from the typical objectivity seen in scientific articles. The bias against climate change enthusiasts was apparent, resulting in emotionally charged articles. This represents an appeal to emotion (Pathos). Hasty generalizations (drawing broad conclusions) were another type of logical fallacy commonly seen from limited or insufficient evidence. The heavy emphasis on data sourced from one place creates a false sense of accuracy, with other perspectives being shielded/hidden from readers’ view. Bombarding readers with figures and statistical data without proper citations was also a common technique used. For non-scientific readers, especially, numbers can be an overwhelming signal of credibility. The strongest, most reliable, and most accurate claims were backed by linked credible sources, statistics, and counterarguments. Observing affiliations with known organizations and universities was also persuasive as a reader.
