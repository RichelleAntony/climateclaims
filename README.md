**URL to the claim’s source:** https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/10/21/oh-the-horror-climate-change-to-make-more-rain-in-the-sahara-desert/

**1-2 sentence summary of the claim:** A climatically dry region (the Sahara Desert) is expected to increase in rainfall by 75% as a consequence of global warming.

**1-2 sentence explanation of why it prompted you to rethink or question your current views:** I anticipated that dry regions would increase due to climate change, increasing the overall frequency and severity of droughts globally. Rising temperatures increase evaporation, so the increase in precipitation was contradictory to my prediction.

**1-2 sentence summary of the claim:** The theoretical threats associated with climate change are a cash grab (“Catastrophic Anthropogenic (Human-caused) Global Warming: CAGW”) exploited by environmental groups. There is evidence that climate change is largely driven by the Sun, and not carbon dioxide. 

**1-2 sentence explanation of why it prompted you to rethink or question your current views:** The media led me to believe that human factors largely drove climate change, but natural factors are more influential, according to this article. I was shocked that only 1-3% of surveyed scientists’ academic papers agree that catastrophic climate change is fueled by human activity.

**1-2 sentence summary of the claim:** The Social Cost of Carbon (the estimated economic harm resulting from carbon emissions) is exaggerated and unreliable, because speculative computer models often overpredict global warming instead of using real-world temperature data (currently equating to ¼ of predicted warming).

**1-2 sentence explanation of why it prompted you to rethink or question your current views:** I had always assumed the social cost of carbon was based on reliable scientific data and accurately depicted the economic and environmental damage of emissions (since it is used to calculate carbon taxes). Carbon taxes, based on these estimates, might be set too high if the Social Cost of Carbon is unreliable.

**1-2 sentence summary of the claim:** 0.6 meters of future sea-level rise could be avoided if emissions between 2020 and 2090 are reduced in accordance with the guidelines of the 2016 Paris Agreement.

**1-2 sentence explanation of why it prompted you to rethink or question your current views:** The significant, direct limitation on sea-level rise made me rethink the value I had underestimated of initiatives like switching from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric vehicles. The cited barriers to such initiatives are easily remediable, such as the lack of charging station availability.

**URL to the claim’s source:** https://www.drroyspencer.com/2025/09/the-hottest-summer-days-in-the-u-s-have-barely-warmed-in-the-last-40-years/

**1-2 sentence summary of the claim:** The hottest summer days across the U.S. have shown minimal and insignificant warming (around 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit). The coolest days and nighttime temperatures have warmed significantly, more so due to urbanization rather than global climate forcing.

**1-2 sentence explanation of why it prompted you to rethink or question your current views:** I had expected global warming to cause equally noticeable temperature increases, and was not anticipating a distinction to occur between the hottest and coolest days. This claim also suggests that the reduction of urbanization reduces warming in a local context, explaining differences in warming distribution.
